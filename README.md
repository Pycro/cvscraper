# cvscraper

Small script that scrapes the current coronavirus status for the UK and writes the number of cases, deaths and recovered to a file.
This runs on a raspberry pi and needs the sensehat as it displays current stats on the sensehat

if you want to use it without sensehat then comment out imports and reference to sensehat display.

you need to pip install bs4 and requests if you havent got them
